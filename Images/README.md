# Images
This folder shows images that were used to create the dungeon game. Most images are from https://pixel-poem.itch.io/dungeon-assetpuck, with edits done using Windows Paint.

Then, the images are resized accordingly to fit within the 96 x 64 screen of the PmodOLED.

Finally, using the python file developed by **me**, the png files were converted into text files with the required format in order for the PmodOLED to process and display the images correctly.
