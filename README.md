# FPGA-Dungeon-Game-EE2026
This repository contains some of the files that my partner, Tze Yeong and I, created to generate a dungeon game using the Basys3 Artix-7 FPGA board, Diligent Pmod OLEDrgb and PmodMIC3 peripherals.
For simplicity, we omitted some files, such as the templates given to us in the beginning.
