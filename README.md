# FPGA-Dungeon-Game
This repository contains the files that my partner, Tze Yeong (**github.com/tantzeyeong**) and I, created to generate a dungeon game using the Basys3 Artix-7 FPGA board, Diligent Pmod OLEDrgb and PmodMIC3 peripherals as part of our final project.

The **SourceFiles** folder shows the main verilog code files used.

The **MemoryInitialization** folder mostly details the images used for the dungeon game.

The **Project Summary** file summarizes the features developed by us.
